##Trump vs Replicants in: Bankruptcy-Jack

###Technologies Used:

##HTML5 | CSS3 | Javascript | JQuery | Git | Github | 

##Through this project I was thrust into the Javascript universe! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧  

After much practice regarding game logic as well as Model - View separation, I started looking for a well know game to emulate. I choose Black Jack because it seemed like a challenging way for me to tackle various aspects of object oriented programming. I wanted to build out my own custom functionality as well as use built in Funciton Object methods such as map/reduce/filter that would give me deeper insight into Javascript datastuctures and prototypal inheritance. The end result is a BladeRunner themed version of BlackJack with dystopian undertones.
