#Taj Mahal Casino Presents...

####Trump vs Replicants in BlackJack

###Prelogue 

The year is 2019 and Replicants have taken over the abandonded Trump Taj Mahal Resort and Casino in Atlantic City, NJ.

Trump's robotic henchmen start scanning binders full of previous lawsuits to see if there is an chance of reclaiming its former stake in the casino but the Replicants aren't having it.

"Beleive me," boasts Trump, "those Replicants are losers."

Across the gilded hallway with marble-tiles, Trump Jr. knows this is serious... "Dad, our cybernetic beauty pagent interns are in need of serious repairs. Have you been kissing them again? I told you that messes with their circuitry." 

"What are you talking about? Nobody has greater respect for cybernetic beauty pagent interns. NOBODY."

The CBPI's are activiated and fill the room with metallic shreiking.

"Ok. Ok....I'll deal with this...I'm going down there myself and settling this once and for all."
