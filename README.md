#Taj Mahal Casino Presents...

####Trump vs Replicants in: Bankruptcy-Jack

###Prelogue 

The year is 2019 and Replicants have taken over the abandonded Trump Taj Mahal Resort and Casino in Atlantic City, NJ.

Trump's robotic henchmen start scanning binders full of previous lawsuits to see if there is any chance of reclaiming its former stake in the casino, but those Replicants aren't having it.

"Believe me," boasts Trump, "those Replicants are losers."

Across the gilded hallway with marble-tiles, Trump Jr. knows this is serious... "Dad, our cybernetic beauty pagent interns are in need of serious repairs. Have you been kissing them again? I told you that messes with their circuitry." 

"What are you talking about? Nobody has greater respect for cybernetic beauty pagent interns. NOBODY."

The CBPI's are activiated and fill the room with metallic shreiking.

"Ok. Ok....I'll deal with this...I'm going down there myself and settling this once and for all."

#Rules:

The rules of Bankruptcy-Jack are the same as BlackJack except if you lose and default on your loans there are no consqeuences for you and somehow that makes you smart.

The Replicant Dealer must automatically hit if his hand is below 17.

The Replicants have provided you $200 USD in their own digital Chin-Yen currency.

Use your self-acknowledged superiorty to beat down on these Replicants or you will permanently lose your ownership in Taj Mahal Casino for a second time and your malfunctioning cybernetic beauty pagents interns will never respect you again.
